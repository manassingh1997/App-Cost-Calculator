This project implements a basic **App Cost Calculator** using Django for the backend and simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The calculator allows users to select an app category and relevant features, dynamically calculates the total cost, and displays it without refreshing the page.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/app-cost-calculator.git
     ```
   - Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Backend Setup (Django)**:
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd app-cost-calculator
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS and Linux:
       ```
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
   - Install Python dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Apply database migrations: #This project does not use any database
     ```
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**:
   - The frontend consists of simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - No additional setup is required for the frontend.

4. **Run the Development Server**:
   - Start the Django development server:
     ```
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
   - You should see the App Cost Calculator running locally!

## Customization

- Adjust the app features and categories in the backend (`calculator/views.py`) and frontend (`calculator/templates/cost_calculator.html` )

## Deployment

To deploy the app on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Render.com, follow their specific deployment instructions.
